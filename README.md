An extension that allows developers to schedule tasks. 

The extension takes a list of jobs that get executed in the background. Along with the executing jobs, the extension has internal features that extend the ability like (auto-start when the device gets rebooted or starting an activity through the URI or Intent).



The extension uses Java reflection that can create classes (*components/extensions*) dynamically.

### ðŸ›  Types of tasks

The extension handles the two types of tasks depending on the mode you set.



**Background (*non-visible*)**

- Mode is for non-visible tasks like (communicating with the web sending requests) that aren't necessary. Also read (restrictions_on_phones).

**Foreground (*user-visible*)**

- The foreground mode is for user-visible tasks like music-player apps that get started immediately. Foreground tasks aren't very likely to be killed the system.
